        <p class="description">Panipuri or Phuchka is a type of snack that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It consists of a round or ball-shaped, hollow puri, filled with a mixture of flavored water, tamarind chutney, chili, chaat masala, potato, onion or chickpeas.

        <span class="title beef">Butter Chicken</span>
        <p class="description">Butter chicken like chicken tikka masala, is one of the most popular Indian curries across the world and for all the right reasons. This delicious chicken recipe is also popular by its Hindi name - murgh makhani. The taste of the creamy bright coloured masala with chunks of grilled chicken in it is an unforgettable one and I love mine with some soft rumali rotis, though you can have it with any kind of Indian flatbread too. Like its north Indian origins and name itself suggests good quantities of butter go into the making of this dish. One taste and you are going to wow that this is the best butter chicken you have ever had.</p>

        <p class="description">Gobi (cauliflower) Manchurian is the result of the adaptation of Chinese cooking and seasoning techniques to suit Indian tastes and has become a staple of Indian Chinese cuisine. The word Manchurian means native or inhabitant of Manchuria. It was originally developed by a small Chinese community which lived in Kolkata since the British Raj. In its two-stage preparation, the first stage requires preparing a spiced corn flour batter, dipping cauliflower florets in it and deep frying them. In the second stage, the deep fried florets are saut√©ed with chopped onion, bell pepper, garlic, etc., in soy and chili sauce.</p>
